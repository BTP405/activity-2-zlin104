  -Approach 1: Firstly, the approach defines a function called doubleL that takes one parameter. Inside this function, it initializes an empty list called res. Then, it creates a for in loop to iterate through 0 to n-1, then multiply each number by 2 and append each result to res list. At the end, the function will return the res list. Outside the function, a for in loop is created to iterate through the list returned by doubleL(5) function call, and prints i :  in each iteration, which i represents the element in the list.

- Approach 2: This approach uses a list comprehension to create a list containing doubled values of numbers from 0 to 4. After that, it loop through the list and print x : , which x represents the element in the list.

- Approach 3: This approach defiines a generator function doubleG(n), this function takes one integer parameter. Inside this function, it creates a for in loop to loop through 0 to n-1, and it uses a yield statement to generate the doubled values of numbers from 0 to n-1 one at a time when needed, and returns a generator object. Next, the approach creates a for in loop to interate over generator object returned by the generator function, and the generator function is called to produce the next value using yield statement in each iteration.

- doubleG(n) is a generator function. The advantage of it is saving memory by using yield statement. Yield statement delays value generation, it only generates the value one at a time when the value is needed instead of creating and storing all values in memory at once. As a result, this saves memory and improves efficiency.
